But fret not there are many out there that are of old age just like you. I must say that it is hard for me to symphasize with you now as I do now understand
how it feels to be OLD. And in your case, it must be even harder due to an underdeveloped frontal cortex. However, please know that I stand with you through
these hard times. I support your decisions so please don't be afraid to take some time to process your oldness.
