Dear player,

Tech-Tac-toe, a game familiar to many. Here you play against a friend, an AI, or yourself! 

Clicking the board will start the game. You can play against a CAT ROBOT, an EXPERT AI or play against yourself or a friend in VERSUS MODE! Are you bored while waiting for the AI to think about its next move? Try playing around with the baord :D

When the game is finished, or when you want to start over, simply press RESET. 

DISCLAIMER: You cannot press RESET when the AI is still thinking, interupting him is rude!

Hope you like my take and implementation of the game. And there is a single type of strategy that will almost always work against the expert AI, can you beat him?

HAVE FUN~!

Sincerely,

Hans
