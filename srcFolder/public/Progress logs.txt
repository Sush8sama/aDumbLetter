I decided to keep some notes/logs as I make this dumb letter thing. This is day 2 of working on this little project. So for context this idea came from a friend that likes to write letters for people. She wrote me a letter for my birthday and so I wanted to write one for theirs. However, we live in different countries sooo doing so was not very evident. At the same time, I am making my own portofolio website with pixel art. With this in mind, during one of my running seshes I suddenly came up with the idea to create a digital envelope hosting website and of course with the pixel art theme. My VISION is to have a website that allows users to customize their own pixel art envelopes and put letters in them. A unique link would then represent their letter, which then can be send over the internet. Dunno if this already exists LOL (probs). For now, created a 3D envelope that can be opened and a single letter appears. Can also be closed. Now gonna implement multiple pages in an envelope :DDD. BYE.

P.S. Developed in React with three.js/three-fiber 嗯嗯~

Worked a bit more on the webapp. Now multipage is implemented lesgooo. Still have to implement: show page count, creating pixel font for letters, logs, potentially pixel background. Time to play some Silksong :D.

Logs function is fully implemented. Not verry happy with the logs sprite and the font is also lowkey weird. Gonna change the font and might redraw the sprite later...

Tweeked the font and sprite. Good enough. Next is to program the letter writing function. Currently it is still very manual. This means adding back end stuff ayayaya. Worries for tomorrow perhaps. Also should redraw some of the button sprites...

Also yeah some stuff definatly not very happy about... need to fix the page turning buttons and pagecount but yahhh for future version will do. AND ONE DAY I will complete this website project surely.
