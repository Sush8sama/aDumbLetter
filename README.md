Making a dumb letter

## test and run locally:
1. go to the client directory
2. `npm run dev`
3. go to server directory in a different terminal
4. `npx ts-node src/server.ts` (during development, compiles and executes on the fly)
For production should compile the ts files to js using typescript compiler to run it natively in node.js

p.s. run `npm install` for both directories on first run!
